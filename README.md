# ⚽ EPL 2024/2025: Predicting Top Scoring Players using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the number of goals a player is likely to score in the 2024/2025 English Premier League (EPL) season using regression techniques.

## 📌 Objective

To build a regression model that predicts player goal counts based on key performance indicators such as:
- Shots and shots on target
- Assists and minutes played
- Progressive carries and passes
- Conversion rates and touches

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains EPL player statistics for the 2024/2025 season with the following key columns:
- Player Name, Club, Nationality, Position
- Appearances, Minutes, Goals (target)
- Shots, Assists, Passes, Carries, Crosses, etc.

## 🔍 Steps Covered

1. Data Cleaning & Exploration
2. Feature Selection & Engineering
3. Regression Modeling (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
4. Model Evaluation (MAE, RMSE, R²)
5. Insight Extraction & Visualization
6. (Optional) Model Deployment or Dashboard

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub

## 📈 Expected Outcome

- Understand key features that impact goal scoring
- Predict goals with reasonable accuracy
- Deliver insights that can help analysts, clubs, and fantasy league enthusiasts
